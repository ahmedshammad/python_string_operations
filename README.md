The Begining of my Python Journey
Ahmed Saad Hammad
This project is based on 4 functions in a module called String_ops

1#Repeated Substring
>> For a given nonempty string s find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k, such that the entire string s is equal to t repeated k times.
Is it a palindrome
2#Simple String Matching
>> Tou will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern. If the string matches, return true else false
3#Is it a palindrome
>> checks if the given word is palindrome
4#find_nth_occurrence
find_nth_occurrence that returns the index of the nth occurrence of a substring within a string (considering that those substring could overlap each others). If there are less than n occurrences of the substring, return -1
